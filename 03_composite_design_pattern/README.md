# Composite Design Pattern

This pattern is intended to represent a tree-like structure. The pattern implements an interface class and concrete implementation of leaf nodes of tree and nodes which compose leaves and nodes together.

A very relatable application of this pattern is the filesystem on a computer. To implement this pattern we will constraint the application to:
- addition or removal of files/folder in the n-ary tree structure
- structure reporting and reporting the size of files, folders, and sub-folders
